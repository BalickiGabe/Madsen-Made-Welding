# Madsen Made - Freelance Business Website Project

## Overview  

Hey there! Welcome to the **Madsen Made** GitHub repo. This is a business website I built from scratch for a client using **React.js** and **Material UI**. The idea was to create something clean, modern, and easy to use that shows off their products and services without any unnecessary clutter.

- **Material UI**: Leveraged pre-built components for a sleek, cohesive design while customizing styles to fit the client’s branding.  

### 📱 **Responsive and User-Friendly**  
- It works great on desktops, tablets, and phones, so no one gets left out.
